# Big-Data-and-Analytics--Project-3
Multiple Linear Regression and Logistic Regression using the Boston housing dataset

Repository containing Python data science project of my Big Data course from the University of Newcastle (Uon) Master of Data Science Degree. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

The project covers the material from Lectures 1-7 and includes:

1: Dataset Import and Preparation<br>
2: Regression<br>
  2.1: Create a new categorical variable<br>
  2.2: Create a set of dummy variables<br>
I have reported the regression results and interpreted with my own words.<br>

3 : Classification<br>
I have reported the logistic regression results and interpreted with my own words.<br>
  3.1 Avaliation of model performance<br>
  3.3 Confunsion matrix and interpretation of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
